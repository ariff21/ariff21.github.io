        <p class="justified-text">First and foremost, I would like to thank to Allah SWT because of his blessing, I was able to complete this first assignment. I also would like to express my special thanks to my IMD311 lecturer, <b>Madam Intan</b> for her kindness and always diligent in aiding my work and give useful guidance for me to do this assignment. Furthermore, I want to say thank you to my friends for giving me some helps and any form of aids when I face some difficulty. Without them, I might not be able to finish this assignment. At the same time, I will never forget my family who has been highly supportive 
        and trusting of my efforts to complete this assignment. I did also like to convey my gratefulness to those who have offered me their device and their time. Especially to all my friends and contact. Because of that, I was able to complete this task with their help and encouragement. Finally, I want to apologize for other unmentioned names who help me in various ways on completing this assignment.</p>
